  <h1>My Portfolio - In development</h1>

## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This portfolio showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a developer. It has been built using React for the front-end and Node.js with npm for the back-end setup. This README will guide you through the process of setting up and running the portfolio locally on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the portfolio project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/portfolio.git
   cd portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The development server will start, and you can view the portfolio in your web browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the React application source code.
- `server/`: Contains the Node.js server code.
- `public/`: Contains static assets and the HTML entry point.
- `package.json`: Defines project dependencies and scripts.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server for both React and Node.js.
- `npm run build`: Builds the React app for production use.
- `npm run server`: Starts the Node.js server independently.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner.
- `npm run eject`: **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
